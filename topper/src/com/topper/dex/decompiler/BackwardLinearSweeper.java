	 * Performs a linear backward sweep on <code>buffer</code>.
	 * 
	 * It does <b>not</b> verify that <code>offset</code> is even,
	 * i.e. a multiple of the code unit size, because the <code>buffer</code>
	 * could be a partial view of a larger buffer. If <code>buffer</code>
	 * started at an odd offset, then having an odd <code>offset</code>
	 * would be valid wrt. the larger buffer. There is no way to tell
	 * whether <code>offset</code> is correct from inside this code.
	 * 
	 * The general approach is to abuse the fact that instructions
	 * are always a multiple of two in size. Therefore, if an
	 * instruction precedes the one pointed to by <code>offset</code>,
	 * then its opcode byte must be located somewhere at offset - 2 * i.
	 * Then, try to decompile all instructions located at offset - 2 * 1,
	 * offset - 2 * 2 etc. until one matches and it directly adjacent
	 * to the pivot instruction. This is repeated over and over until
	 * either the buffer is exhausted, or the upper bound on the
	 * number of instructions is hit.
	 * 
	 * @param buffer Buffer, from which to extract instructions.
	 * @param offset Starting point of the sweep relative to the beginning of the
	 * 	buffer. It must point to a valid instruction.
	 * @return List of decompiled instructions preceding the instruction
	 * 	located at <code>offset</code> in <code>buffer</code>. The instruction
	 * 	pointer to by <code>offset</code> is also part of this list.
