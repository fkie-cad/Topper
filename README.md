# Topper

*Topper* aims to support performing bytecode - based attacks on Android. For now, *Topper* enables loading `.dex` and `.vdex` files, extracting *TOP gadgets* and performing *TOP attacks*. Also, a few information gathering commands are implemented to prevent tool - hopping.

## Project Setup

*Topper* is fully implemented using Java and Maven. As this repo is based on an Eclipse project, one may be able to directly import it as such.
